# Hi! I'm asoscuotÔºåFinally waiting for you ü§ò

Thanks for checking out my profileÔºÅ

I come from China and am a university student majoring in computer science. I have not been exposed to programming languages for a long time
but I am very interested in C language and Java language. I hope to continue to develop in this field! The school is currently offering Java web learning. 
If everyone is willing to share this knowledge with me, I would be very  very happy!

- ‚óºÔ∏èI deeply love these languages and want to pursue such a career in the future
- üíª Windows Linux is learning... How can I exit Vim??ü§î
- üí¨ Everyone can chat with me if they have something to do or nothing to do
- üì±
  - email:1205434837@qq.com  
- üé∏ I often play the piano and enjoy music outside of programming time, and I don't know how many people are like me
